 * This interface defines a contract for implementing a data reader that can
 * read URL-originated streams. Since plain-text streams such as comma- and tab-
 * separated formats can be very different from Excel streams in their command-set,
 * this interface aims to describe a consistent, easy-to-use, and easy-to-maintain
 * and enhance approach.
 * 
 * New stream types can be easily implemented by simply implementing these
 * methods.
