 * This class defines methods to fetch data from any page with an HTML table
 * with id <code>phenotypes</code>. Currently both the gene and phenotype pages
 * contain such a table whose contents are similar but whose columns differ
 * slightly in both name and order. Common processing code should go in this
 * superclass while individual page implementation details, such as the column
 * count and indexes should go into derived classes. These derived classes are
 * the ones that should be instantiated.
