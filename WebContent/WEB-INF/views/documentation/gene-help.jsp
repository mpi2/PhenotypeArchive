                            		the current gene, grouped by zygosity, sex and top level MP term. The icons on the right hand side show a visual summary of the same data. </p>
                            <p> MP terms may have more than one high level parent and so the counts in the summary may not equal the total number of entries in the table.</p>

                            <p>We offer 2 export options for the data in the table: </p>

                                <li> TSV, text file with tab separated variables </li>

                                In the table displayed on our page entry lines are collapsed based on sex. That is, if for 2 lines all fields are identical except the gender, they will be shown together for a better user experience.
                                In the export file however we export all lines separately, to allow easier further processing of the data. This holds for both XLS and TSV files.

In order to be marked Complete, 7 males and 7 females must complete all core screens required by the IMPC pipeline.
