                            <p>
                            High-throughput phenotyping generates large volumes of varied data including 
                            both categorical and continuous data. Operational and cost constraints can 
                            lead to a work-flow that precludes traditional analysis methods. Furthermore, 
                            for a high throughput environment, a robust automated statistical pipeline 
                            that alleviates manual intervention is required.</p>

                            <p>The IMPC uses a variety of statistical methods for making phenotype calls, including:</p>

                            <ul>

                            The Mixed model and Fisher's Exact methods used have been formalized into an R package called

                            an effect size measure, model diagnostics (when appropriate),

                            The PhenStat package provides statistical methods for

                            adds noise and models variables accordingly in 
                            order to separate the batch and the genotype. Model

                            The Mixed Model framework is an iterative process to select the 
                            best model for the data which considers both the best modelling 
                            approach (mixed model or general linear regression) 
                            and which factors to include in the model.

                            If PhenStat assumptions about the input data are not met, a second attempt at analyzing the data
                            will be attempted -- a Mann-Whitney U Rank Sum test.

                            <p>One side effect of producing data in a high throughput pipeline is that the input data for a statistical calculation might be produced over multiple days.
                            Environmental fluctuations have been identified as a confounding factor when comparing 
                            data gathered on different days.  The IMPC describes this as a "batch effect" and it is treated as a random effect in the Mixed Model framework.

							<p>If the mutant genotype effect represents a significant change from the control group, then the IMPC pipeline will
							attempt to associate a <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/MP_form.shtml">Mammalian Phenotype (MP) term</a> to the data.</p>
							
							<p>The particular MP term(s) defined for a parameter are maintained in <a href="https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress">IMPReSS</a>.  
							Frequently, the term indicates an <strong>increase</strong> or <strong>decrease</strong> of the parameter measured.</p>
							
							<p>When a statistical result is determined as significant, the following diagram is used for associating MP term:</p>

							<h4>Significance</h4>
							
							<p>When a mutant genotype effect P value is less than 1.0E-4 (i.e. 0.0001) it is considered significant.</p>
