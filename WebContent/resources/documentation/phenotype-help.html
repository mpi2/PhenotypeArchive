			<div class="page-header"><h3>Explore the diverse entry points to mouse phenotype data.</h3></div> 
			<p>
				Our phenotype page currently consists of two main parts: the phenotype information/details and the table of gene variants associated with the current phenotype.
			</p>
			<img src="img/phenotype-page.png"/>
			
			<h3><a name="details" href='#'>Phenotype details</a></h3>
				<p>The <b>synonyms</b> and <b>definition</b> we provide come from the mouse phenotype ontology (MP). This is also why we provide the MP id of the current
				 phenotype page as well as the link to it on the <b>MGI MP browser</b>.</p>
				 
				 <p> The <b>procedures</b> come from legacy data pipelines such as EUMODIC, GMC and they will change in the future. </p>
				
				<figure>
				<img class="well" src="img/phenotype-information.png"/>
				</figure>
				
				<h3><a name="phenotype-stats-panel" href='#'>Phenotype Association Stats</a></h3>
				<img class="well" src="img/phenotype-associations-stats.png"/>
				<p> IMPC mouse strains are subjected to a wide range of phenotype assays, allowing for estimates on the percentage of genes that when knocked out contribute to 
				a phenotype. As multiple parameters may map to the same phenotype, percentages are calculated across all parameters that map to a phenotype. The percentage of genes 
				associated to the current phenotype in one sex only, for example females is the number of genes associated to phenotypeX in 
				females divided by the total number of genes tested in females for parameters potentially leading to phenotypeX associations. Thus, the percent 
				values we show for females and males do not have to add up to 1 nor do the percentages for males/females only need to be smaller than the combined percentage.</p>
				<p> The data used for this panel is restricted to EuroPhenome data on B6N and B6NTac strains, to reduce background noise. </p> 				
			<h3><a name="associations" href='#'>Gene-Phenotype associations</a></h3>
			
			<p>All gene variants associated with the current phenotype are shown in a table similar to the one on the gene page. The table contains several fields of interest such 
			as gene name and the corresponding allele, zygosity, sex, data source, parameter, a link to the <a href="graph-help.html">graph</a> when one is available as well as the 
			used procedure <i>or</i> directly associated phenotype, depending on the MP term (see <a href="phenotype-help.html#dvi">Direct vs. inferred associations</a>).
			<p>Rows are collapsed based on sex. For more readability we group entries where all fields are identical except the sex to one row. These rows are identified by 
			a both-sexes icon (<img src="img/both-sexes-icon.png"/>). The <b>total number of results</b> shown on top of the table will double count this rows (once for females 
			and once for males).</p>
			
			
			<h3><a name="dvi" href='#'>Direct vs. inferred associations</a></h3>
			
				<p> The gene associations table on the phenotype page comes in two slightly different flavors, depending on how the phenotype is associated</p>
					<p> (1) phenotype terms that are directly annotated to data</p>
					<p> (2) phenotype terms whose gene associations have been inferred</p>		
			
				<h5> Lower level MP terms, directly associated </h5>
				<p>The associations come directly from the pipelines. At the moment this is the case for the vast majority of the phenotype pages.</p>
				<img class="well" src="img/phenotype-help-directly-annotated-mp.png"/>
				
				<h5>Higher level MP terms and the transitively associated gene variants</h5>
				<p>This is the case only for the top level at the moment, but we might add intermediate terms too. One way to navigate to these pages is from the
				 <a href="gene-help.html#phenotype-summary">phenotype summary</a> on the gene page or you could simply do search for a top level MP term.</p>				 
				<p> The image below pictures the table for a top level term (growth/size phenotype). We obtain this information by joining information from all ontology descendants 
				of the current MP term.    
				To keep the granularity of the MP term associations we introduced phenotype information in
				 the table (highlighted in red below).
				 To ease the navigation all MP terms in the table have hyperlinks to their respective IMPC page. </p>				 
				<p> We also add a new filter, the actual phenotype terms associated, also highlighted in the image below. </p>
				<img class="well" src="img/phenotype-help-top-level-table.png"/>
				
				
			<h3><a name="table-filtering" href='#'>Table filtering</a></h3>
			
				<p>The filters over the gene variants associations table offer flexible filtering possibilities. Multiple checkboxes can be selected from any filter dropdown list 
				and the table will automatically reload with each new selected option. 
				These changes will be mirrored by the total number of results over the table as well as by the table export.  </p>
				<p>Multiple filters from the same dropdown list will be joined by a logical OR while between different lists we will use AND. </p>
				<img src ="img/phenotype-filters.png"/>
				
				
			<h3><a name="table-download" href='#'>Downloading results</a></h3>
				<p> The results in the table may be downloaded for further processing. The resulting download respects all filters that have been applied to the data.</p>
				<p> We offer 2 export options for the data in the table:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li> TSV, text file with tab separated variables (<img title="TSV" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="img/tsv.png"/>)</li>
					<li> XLS, Microsoft Excel spread sheet (<img title="XSL" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="img/xls.png"/>)</li>
				</ul>		
				<p> Please note that in the table displayed on our page entry lines are collapsed based on sex. That is, if for 2 lines all fields are identical except the gender, 
					they will be shown together for a better user experience.
					In the export file however we export all lines separately, to allow easier further processing of the data. This holds for both XLS and TSV files. </p>
