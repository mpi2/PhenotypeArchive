                      EBI Phenotype Archive Release Notes

Introduction
------------
The EBI Phenotype Archive is an open source project to store, analyse and 
present genotype associated phenotypes information on the web.
This project is funded by the NIH KOMP2 grant and supported by the IMPC 
consortium.

The web application runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat.

See https://github.com/mpi2/PhenotypeArchive for more information.
