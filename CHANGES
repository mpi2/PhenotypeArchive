The EMBL-EBI Phenotype Archive is an open source project to store, analyse and 
present genotype associated phenotypes information on the web.
This project is currently funded by the NIH KOMP2 grant and supported by the IMPC 
consortium.

The web application runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat.

See our wiki at https://github.com/mpi2/PhenotypeArchive/wiki for more information.
